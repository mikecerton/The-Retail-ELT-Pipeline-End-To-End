# The-Retail-ELT-Pipeline-End-To-End-project
## Overview
&emsp;The goal of this project is to design and implement an ETL data pipeline that ingests raw retail data, processes it, and stores it in a data warehouse for analysis and visualization. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow, hosted locally with Docker Compose. AWS S3 serves as the data lake, while AWS Redshift functions as the data warehouse. Finally, the processed data is visualized using Looker Studio for insights and reporting.
